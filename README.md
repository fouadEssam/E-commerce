# ðŸ“„ A brief description about the E-commerse dataset

This dataset is having data of customers who buys clothes online. The store offers in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.<br>
The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.

# Our Goal 
1- To prepare data for analysis and visulaiztion <br>
2- To determine where the company should focus more attention, whether on their mobile app experience or their website, by visualizing the difference in the amount of money spent between them.<br>
3-Finally, using a machine learning model To predict the Yearly Amount Spent based on the other features. This will help determine whether the time spent on the app or the website has a greater impact on the amount spent.<br>
