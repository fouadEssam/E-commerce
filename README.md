# ðŸ“„ A brief description about the E-commerse dataset

This dataset is having data of customers who buys clothes online.<br> The store offers in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.<br>
The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.

----
# Our Goal 
1- To prepare data for analysis and visulaiztion <br>
2- To determine where the company should focus more attention, whether on their mobile app experience or their website, by visualizing the difference in the amount of money spent between them.<br>
3-Finally, using a machine learning model To predict the Yearly Amount Spent based on the other features. This will help determine whether the time spent on the app or the website has a greater impact on the amount spent.<br>

# ðŸ§® Some insights

Based on the scatter plot you provided, here are some insights and suggestions:

### Insights
1. **Time on App vs. Yearly Amount Spent**:
   - The red data points represent the relationship between `Time on App` and `Yearly Amount Spent`.
   - There seems to be a positive trend, indicating that as the time spent on the app increases, the yearly amount spent also tends to increase.

2. **Time on Website vs. Yearly Amount Spent**:
   - The blue data points represent the relationship between `Time on Website` and `Yearly Amount Spent`.
   - The trend is less clear compared to the app, suggesting a weaker relationship between time spent on the website and the yearly amount spent.

# Recommendations
 **Focus on Mobile App**:
  - Given the stronger positive trend between `Time on App` and `Yearly Amount Spent`, it appears that the mobile app has a more significant impact on customer spending.
  -  Enhancing the mobile app experience could potentially lead to higher customer engagement and increased spending.<br>
  - Less Focus on Website: The negligible correlation between Time on Website and Yearly Amount Spent indicates that improvements to the website may not significantly impact spending. <br>
  - Investigate Length of Membership: The perfect correlation with Yearly Amount Spent is unusual and should be investigated further to ensure data integrity. <br>
